### Style and Citation/References
The list below provides some useful links for considerations of writing style, as well as style guides for citations and references. Ideallyl, you should choose the style guide generally accepted within your concentration area. For example, history and anthropology may have some specific, stylistic differences, but both tend to use variations of the *Chicago Manual of Style*. The main rule is **be consistent**; choose a style and stick with it. 

EOUâs Pierce Library has [some excellent resources](http://library.eou.edu/help/style.htm) to help students properly cite sources. Additionally, the EOU Writing Center has some resources for improving your writing, in general, and some [specific resources](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdiigo.com%2F07c9oi&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGrDNzCv2J9UwJEQu-UxEyFXkvSTg) that help students avoid [plagiarism](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsulibs.wsu.edu%2Flibrary-instruction%2Fplagiarism%2Fwhat&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG5l3uKEvZ8H_bh-Q1e2sGiLIDVQQ).

(1st edition also freely available [electronically](http://www.bartleby.com/141/) )------This classic, bestselling style guide is a simple, straightforward reference for effective writing.

* [American Anthropological Association (AAA) Style Guide](http://www.aaanet.org/publications/style_guide.pdf)------The default style guide for the field of anthropology; used by AAA publications among others. If no rule exists in the AAA Guide, follow the [Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html) (CMS).

- [American Association of Physical Anthropologist (AAPA) Style Guide](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1096-8644/homepage/ForAuthors.html)------If your research topic area is biological anthropology and you do not use AAA style, use the AAPA style. It is also available as a [*.pdf](http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/ANTH/pdfs/style_pdf/american_journal_physical_anthropology_v115n3-v114n1.pdf).

- [Society for American Archaeology (SAA) Style Guide](http://www.saa.org/Portals/0/SAA/Publications/StyleGuide/StyleGuide_Final_813.pdf)------If your research topic area is archaeology, use the SAA style.

All cited sources should be included at the end of your paper, beginning on a page titled "References Cited" or "Works Cited."  While it can be counter-productive to require a minimum number of references, it is not unreasonable to expect that for a 10--13-page paper, one could easily need at least 15 references, especially since much of the information reported would not be considered general knowledge. __Thus, you must include a minimum of 10 references. Of these, only _four_ can be electronic sources (meaning websites); the remainder must be scholarly books and/or articles from peer-reviewed, scholarly journals.__ This can include scholarly, peer-reviewed journals that are accessible online (e.g., PLOS ONE) and electronically-available material of print journals. Some acceptable scholarly journals that you will likely use include---but are not limited to--- the following:  _American Journal of Physical Anthropology_, _Nature_, _Science_, _American Anthropologist_, _Current Anthropology_, _Journal of Anthropological Sciences_, _American Antiquity_, and _American Journal of Sociology_. 


### Content Requirements
The main outcome of this assignment is that students will present biographical research on a person who has made a significant contribution to the development of anthropological theory. In writing the paper, then, students should focus on answering questions in from two general perspectives:  the person's biographical information (e.g., aspects of the person's birth/death, upbringing, educational background, personal relationships, etc.) and theoretical contributions to anthropology (e.g., intellectual influences, main theoretical positions/arguments, specialized research area, criticisms of, legacy in anthropological theory, etc.). You should expect to draw connections between aspects of your individual's personal life and their intellectual life.



### Assessment/Grading
Your paper will be graded using the following rubric. All parts are not weighted equally. For example, content and your understanding of your chosen personality's work and theoretical positions (including criticisms leveled against those positions) counts more than grammar/style. At the same time, logical organization and good writing style (grammar, spelling, etc.) will affect how you present that content to express your ideas.

#### Avoiding Plagiarism
Not to beat a dead horse, but Eastern Oregon University places a high value upon the integrity of its student scholars. Plagiarism, __even if unintentional__, is an actionable offense of the EOU [Student Handbook](http://www.eou.edu/sse/student-handbook). Again, Pierce Libray has [some great resources](http://library.eou.edu/help/style.htm) for properly citing your sources. If uncertain, here are some suggested [tips to avoid plagiarsim](http://www.nwmissouri.edu/library/services/plagtips.htm).
