## Course Description
EOU Catalog Description:

> This course is a senior-level seminar examining the development of anthropological ideas and concepts. Includes key theories and individuals in the past, as well as important contemporary themes and issues in cultural anthropology, and the other subdisciplines.

This course is designed to provide the student with an exploration of the history of anthropological ideas and theories that inform the modern discipline of anthropology, especially where it concerns the study of human societies and human cultural systems. Content will focus largely on the area of sociocultural anthropology but will include the other subfields (archaeology, biological, and linguistic), from time to time. An understanding of the basic philosophical and theoretical foundations of any academic discipline, as well as their historical context and intellectual progression through time, is essential if we are to fine-tune our abilities as scholars and researchers in our chosen field. Such an understanding is also necessary if one is to challenge or change certain aspects of the discipline in order to bring it more into line with its own stated ideals.

In this course, students explore some of the major social theories and debates that have, and continue to, inspire and inform anthropological analysis. In doing so, the development of anthropological theory is presented within a chronological framework. Students will examine philosophies from antiquity that largely influenced thinking of humans' place in nature through the Middle Ages. The majority of content covers the development of anthropological theory in the nineteenth and twentieth century, specifically how major issues and debates play out in different branches of the field over this time span, and considers how developments in anthropology might be related to other historical and academic developments.

Through assigned readings and classroom discussions, students will investigate a range of theoretical propositions concerning such topics as agency, gender, structure, subjectivity, power, culture, and the politics of representation. We will approach each theoretical perspective or proposition on three levels: (1) in terms of its analytical or explanatory power for understanding human behavior and the social world; (2) in the context of the social and historical circumstances in which they were produced; and (3) as contributions to ongoing dialogues and debate.


## Required Texts
- Erickson, Paul A., and Liam D. Murphy, eds. _Readings for a history of anthropological theory_, 4th edition. University of Toronto Press, 2013.

Some additional readings may be assigned and will be made available in [Canvas](https://eou.instructure.com/login). **If you haven't yet used Canvas---or, even if you have and need help or additional resources---check out [EOU's "Student Resources for Canvas" page](https://www.eou.edu/lms/student-resources/).**


## Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to do the following:

1. Explain/discuss some of the general theories that have shaped the discipline of anthropology.

2. Outline the general context and chronology of the development of anthropological ideas relative to other ideas in western and global traditions.

3. Define/identify the major concepts and terminology that comprise the anthropological endeavor.

4. Discuss intelligently some of the many controversial and/or problematic issues in contemporary anthropology.

5. Analyze and discuss the work of an important individual within the discipline.



## Course Requirements and Grading
There will be no exams in this course. There will, however, be a significant amount of reading, writing, and engagement in discussion. Your grade will be based on your notes on the readings, , a biographical research paper, and your general preparedness and participation throughout the course, including participation on the discussion board. The essays will be based on the readings, lectures, and forum discussions; the biographical research paper will allow you to review the life and work of  a single anthropologist. 

- **Reading notes (20%)**:  Reading notes (of approximately one page per reading) are required for each reading. The notes for any specific, assigned reading are due in class the day each specific reading is discussed. Preferably, your notes will be typed (submit hard copies in class or through Bb's Assignment tool). Reading notes are reflections on the dayâ€™s readings: statements of the argument(s), critical commentary, and discussion questions.

- **Class discussion (30%)**:  It is expected that the students in this course will participate openly in class discussions. Please feel free to express yourself in class. Ask questions if you don't understand or need more explanation, or have a comment or a dissenting opinion. Argue (respectfully and intelligently) with the instructor and your fellow classmates; human knowledge is not set in concrete--it is changing and evolving all the time.  If you have a different view or interpretation of events, speak up!  

- **Discussion facilitation (25%)**:  Students must facilitate class discussions for at least three separate readings. Facilitation cannot be on consecutive readings. On the days that you facilitate, you must provide a copy of your notes for the reading.  This should be written for everyone to understand (i.e., more-formally than your typical notes). Your typed notes will be circulated among students at the beginning of class to help focus class discussions.

- **Biographical research paper (25%)**:  The research paper will be due toward the end of the course. I will discuss all assignments in greater detail and give you guidelines and instructions for all assignments.
