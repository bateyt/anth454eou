## Blackboard or Canvas?

Since EOU is migrating all online courses to Canvas by the Fall 2015 term, __I have decided to deploy this couse in Canvas__.

- If you haven't yet taken an online class in Canvas, please take a short time---seriously, less than 12 minutes---and watch the Canvas Student Orientation Video, created by EOU's rockin' IT staff and provided in the next slide. _(You can also watch the video at a later time by following the link below the video.)_

## Required Texts
Erickson, Paul A., and Liam D. Murphy, eds. _Readings for a history of anthropological theory_, 4th edition. University of Toronto Press, 2013.

- Yes, you need the most-recent (4th) edition.
- It's available for order at the EOU Bookstore:
    + ![](http://bateyt.github.io/anth454eou/assets/pics/anth454_bookstore.png)
- Also, you may obtain the book from another online retailer (e.g., Amazon, textbooks.com, etc.)
- Some additional readings may be assigned and will be made available in Canvas.

## Coming soon...

- More information on the class will be added to this presentation by the start of the Winter 2015 term.

- If you'd like a _general_ idea of the content and structure of the class, see [this __*old*__ syllabus](http://bateyt.github.io/anth454eou/syllabus.html). Please keep in mind that this syllabus was for an on-campus section of ANTH 454 taught in Spring 2014. In other words, the syllabus will be updated, particularly in class structure, to better suit an online environment.

- For more information, please contact [Trey Batey](mailto:ebatey@eou.edu).
