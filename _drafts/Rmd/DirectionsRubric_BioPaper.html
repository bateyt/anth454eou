<div id="general-formatting-requirements" class="section level3">
<h3>General Formatting Requirements</h3>
<p>The paper should be a length of 10-15 pages, NOT including your title page and references cited list (bibliography). Use Times New Roman font, size 10–12pt. The body of the paper must be double-spaced. Section headers should be in bold-face type, with only one extra line separating the section header from the preceeding body text. Use one-inch margins all around. All pages after the title page and page one need a header that includes your last name and page number (e.g., Batey, 2).</p>
</div>
<div id="style-and-citationreferences" class="section level3">
<h3>Style and Citation/References</h3>
<p>The list below provides some useful links for considerations of writing style, as well as style guides for citations and references. Ideallyl, you should choose the style guide generally accepted within your concentration area. For example, history and anthropology may have some specific, stylistic differences, but both tend to use variations of the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em>. The main rule is <strong>be consistent</strong>; choose a style and stick with it.</p>

<h3>Content Requirements</h3>
<p>The main outcome of this assignment is that students will present biographical research on a person who has made a significant contribution to the development of anthropological theory. In writing the paper, then, students should focus on answering questions in from two general perspectives: the person’s biographical information (e.g., aspects of the person’s birth/death, upbringing, educational background, personal relationships, etc.) and theoretical contributions to anthropology (e.g., intellectual influences, main theoretical positions/arguments, specialized research area, criticisms of, legacy in anthropological theory, etc.). Of course, you should expect to drawin connections between aspects of your individual’s personal life and their intellectual life.</p>
</div>
<div id="assessmentgrading" class="section level3">
<h3>Assessment/Grading</h3>
<p>Your paper will be graded using the following rubric. All parts are not weighted equally. For example, content and your understanding of your chosen personality’s work and theoretical positions (including criticisms leveled against those positions) counts more than grammar/style. At the same time, logical organization and good writing style (grammar, spelling, etc.) will affect how you present that content to express your ideas.  </p>
